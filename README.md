# Student Management System Assessment

This project is a Student Management System built with Next.js, React, Node.js, and MongoDB. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing students, courses, and their corresponding results. The main features include:

## Home Page

The homepage acts as a navigation hub, providing links to various pages such as adding new students, viewing students list, adding new courses, viewing courses list, adding new results, and viewing results list.

## Add New Students Page

Users can add new students through a form that includes first name, family name, date of birth, and email address fields. The form validates input data, ensuring all fields are filled and that the email address is valid. Upon successful addition, a notification is shown.

## Students List Page

This page displays a tabular list of all students, and it includes a delete button for each student. Clicking the delete button removes the corresponding student from the list.

## Add New Courses Page

Users can add new courses using a simple form with a course name field. Upon successful addition, a notification is shown.

## Courses List Page

This page displays a tabular list of all courses, and it includes a delete button for each course. Clicking the delete button removes the corresponding course from the list.

## Add New Results Page

Users can add new results by selecting a course and a student from dropdown boxes and providing a score (A, B, C, D, E, F). Upon successful addition, a notification is shown.

## Results List Page

This page displays a tabular list of all scores, showing course and student names, along with their corresponding scores. If a course or student is deleted, their scores will no longer appear on this page.
